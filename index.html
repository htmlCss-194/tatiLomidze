            <h1>2024 BENJAMIN FRANKLIN TRANSATLANTIC FELLOWSHIP (BFTF)</h1>
            <p class="mainTxt" >The U.S Embassy in Tbilisi is pleased to announce the Benjamin Franklin Transatlantic Fellowship (BFTF) for the summer of 2024. The four-week program is scheduled to take place in-person from June 22 to July 20, 2024. The program addresses U.S. foreign policy priorities such as youth engagement, democracy and civil society development, and economic prosperity.  The program will be fully funded by the U.S. Department of State and hosted by Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.

                The Benjamin Franklin Transatlantic Fellowship is an intensive short-term exchange program, created to foster relationships among young Europeans and Americans to build strong linkages and an awareness of shared values.  The four-week program will enable students, ages 16-18, to explore U.S. foreign policy priorities such as youth engagement, support for democracy and civil society, and economic prosperity.  The program will consist of a series of lectures, seminar discussions and presentations, and a broad assortment of practical, faculty- and mentor-led workshops.  The coursework and classroom activities will be complemented by community service activities, site visits, social and cultural activities, and homestays with American families to deepen participants’ experience of U.S. society during their exchange.  
                
                Candidates must demonstrate interest in pursuing leadership opportunities in their home countries and convey a genuine desire to learn about the United States and its people, society, and institutions.
